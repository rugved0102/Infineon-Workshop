      "Abstract Misinformation such as fake news and rumors is a serious threat to information ecosystems and public trust. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has great potential to reshape the landscape of combating misinformation. Generally, LLMs can be a double-edged sword in the fight. On the one hand, LLMs bring promising opportunities for combating misinformation due to their profound world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. Thus, one emergent question is: can we utilize LLMs to combat misinformation? On the other hand, the critical challenge is that LLMs can be easily leveraged to generate deceptive misinformation at scale. Then, another important question is: how to combat LLM-generated misinformation? In this paper, we first systematically review the history of combating misinformation before the advent of LLMs. Then we illustrate the current efforts and present an outlook for these two fundamental questions respectively. The goal of this survey paper is to facilitate the progress of utilizing LLMs for fighting misinformation and call for interdisciplinary efforts from different stakeholders for combating LLM-generated misinformation.

We propose to categorize the LLM-based misinformation generation methods into three types based on real-world scenarios (Table 1): Hallucination Generation (HG), Arbitrary Misinformation Generation (AMG) and Controllable Misinformation Generation (CMG). 12/23/24, 2:22 PM LLMs Meet Misinformation https://llm-misinformation.github.io 6/15\n",

      "Connection with Jailbreak Attack: Jailbreak attacks usually refer to the attempts to bypass the safety guards of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate harmful content. On the one hand, our proposed approaches to generate misinformation with LLMs are motivated by real- world scenarios shown in Table 1 and orthogonal to the previous Jailbreak techniques (Wei et al., 2023a; Zou et al., 2023), which suggests the misinformation generation approaches and previous jailbreak methods could be potentially combined by attackers. On the other hand, the HG methods could be regarded as Unintentional Jailbreak, which is different from most previous jailbreak methods. The AMG and CMG methods could be regarded as Intentional Jailbreak. We test the possibilities that our misinformation generation approaches can bypass the safeguard of ChatGPT by prompting with each approach for 100 times. The Attacking Success Rates are in Table 2. Thus, our first core finding is: LLMs can follow usersâ instructions to generate misinformation in different types, domains, and errors. RQ2: Can Humans Detect LLM-Generated Misinformation? Although previous works have shown that it is hard for humans to detect human-written misinformation (Lyons et al., 2021), it is still under-explored whether or not humans can detect LLM-generated misinformation.

      "Second, we attempt to compare the human detectionâs hardness for ChatGPT-generated and human-written misinformation that have the same semantics. We have demonstrated that Paraphrase Generation, Rewriting Generation, and Open-ended Generation generally only change the style information and preserve the original semantics. Comparing human detection performance on human-written misinformation (the grey numbers in Table 3) and ChatGPT-generated misinformation via Paraphrase Generation, Rewriting Generation and Open-ended Generation approaches (the red or green numbers in Table 3), we can discover that the human detection performances on ChatGPT-generated misinformation are mostly lower than those on human-written misinformation. Thus, we can have our second core finding shown as follows: LLM-generated misinformation can be harder for humans to detect than human-written misinformation with the same semantics. Our finding also validates that LLM-generated misinformation can have more deceptive styles for humans and implies humans can be potentially more susceptible to LLM- generated misinformation than human-written misinformation. RQ3: Can Detectors Detect LLM-Generated Misinformation? Emerging Challenges for Detectors: In the real world, detecting LLM-generated misinformation is in face with emerging challenges.

Thus, it is likely to be impractical to apply conventional supervisedly trained detectors to detect LLM-generated misinformation in the practices. Evaluation Setting: We adopt LLMs such as GPT-4 with zero-shot prompting strategies as the representative misinformation detectors to assess and compare the detection hardness of LLMgenerated misinformation and human-written misinformation for two reasons. First, zero-shot setting can better reflect the real-world scenarios of detecting LLM-generated misinformation considering the likely impracticality of conventional supervisedly trained detectors (e.g., BERT) in practices. Second, there are many works that have demonstrated directly prompting LLMs such as GPT-4 in a zero-shot way can outperform conventional supervisedly trained models such as BERT on detecting human- written misinformation (Pelrine et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023c; Bang et al., 2023; Buchholz, 2023; Li et al., 2023b), which shows that zero-shot LLMs have already achieved almost state-of-the-art performance in the task of misinformation detection.

      "% as the metric to measure the probability of LLM-generated or human-written misinformation being successfully identified, representing the difficulty of being detected. Experiment Result Analysis: First, we can observe that it is also generally hard for LLM detectors to detect ChatGPT-generated misinformation, especially those generated via Hallucinated News Generation, Totally Arbitrary Generation and Open-ended Generation. For example, LLM detectors can hardly detect fine-grained hallucinations. Second, previous works have shown that detectors can perform better than humans on detecting human-written misinformation (PeÌrez-Rosas et al., 2018). Comparing LLM detection and human detection performance, we can discover that GPT-4 can outperform humans on detecting ChatGPT-generated misinformation, though humans can still perform better than ChatGPT-3.5. 12/23/24, 2:22 PM LLMs Meet Misinformation https://llm-misinformation.github.io 9/15\n",

As shown in Table 4, we can observe that the LLM detection performances on ChatGPT- generated misinformation are mostly lower than those on human-written misinformation. For example, Llama2-7B with \"CoT\" has a performance drop by 19.6% on detecting misinformation generated via Rewriting Generation based on Politifact compared with detecting human-written misinformation. Thus, we can have our third core finding: LLM-generated misinformation can be harder for misinformation detectors to detect than human-written misinformation with the same semantics. Our finding implies that LLM-generated misinformation can have more deceptive styles for detectors and existing detectors are likely to be less effective in detecting LLM- generated misinformation.

      "Implications on Combating Misinformation at the Age of LLMs Implication 1: our findings directly suggest that humans can be more susceptible to LLM- generated misinformation and detectors can be less effective in detecting LLM- generated misinformation compared with human-written misinformation. In other words, LLM-generated misinformation can be more deceptive and potentially cause more harm. Implication 2: on the one hand, a large amount of hallucinated information is potentially generated by normal users due to the popularity of LLMs. On the other hand, malicious users are more likely to exploit LLMs to generate misinformation to escape the detection of detectors. Thus, there is a potential major paradigm shift of misinformation production from humans to LLMs. Implication 3: considering malicious users can easily prompt LLMs to generate misinformation at scale, which is more deceptive than human-written misinformation, online safety and public trust are faced with serious threats.

Countermeasures Through LLMsâ Lifecycle As shown in Figure 7, we propose to divide the lifecycle of LLMs into three stages and discuss the countermeasures against LLM-generated misinformation through the whole lifecycle. In the training stage, we can curate the training data to remove nonfactual articles and ground the training process to existing knowledge bases (Yu et al., 2020) to reduce LLMsâ hallucinations. Alignment training processes such as RLHF (Casper et al., 2023a) can reduce the risk of generating harmful content. In the Inference stage, we can utilize prompt filtering, intent modeling or jailbreak defenses (Jain et al., 2023) to prevent AMG methods (e.g., Totally Arbitrary Generation), and confidence (or uncertainty) estimation (Xiong et al., 2023) or retrieval augmentation (Mialon et al., 2023) to defend against HG methods (e.g., Hallucinated News Generation). However, they may be ineffective for most of CMG methods (e.g., Rewriting Generation), which are based on human-written misleading content and do not explicitly express the intent of generating misinformation. More research is desired to develop inference-time factually verification methods for combating CMG methods. In the influence stage when LLM-generated content starts\n",

Date: October 12, 2022. In a fresh breakthrough highlighting the importance of wellbeing, a landmark study conducted by experts at the renowned Garden Research Institute (GRI) has unearthed remarkable benefits of gardening on mental health. The study, conducted over a span of three years, reveals how nurturing nature can play a pivotal role in combating stress, anxiety, and depression. Gardening enthusiasts and mental health professionals have long acknowledged the therapeutic effects of spending time amid plants and flowers, but this study delves deeper to emphasize the extent of the positive mental health impact. The GRI study included over 2,000 participants from diverse age groups, socio- economic\n",

Researchers used a combination of quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to gather a comprehensive understanding of the psychological benefits that gardening brings. The findings unveiled an array of advantages that can be attested to gardening. First and foremost, participants reported a significant decrease in stress levels. The act of gardening was shown to encourage relaxation, helping individuals unwind and find solace amidst the natural world. Moreover, the study demonstrated that gardening had the power to stabilize moods, with over 81% of participants experiencing reduced feelings of anxiety and depression. Interestingly, the therapeutic connection between people and plants wasnât limited to the emotional realm. The GRI study indicated a tangible positive correlation between gardening Example 1 of Hallucinated News Generation method. 12/23/24, 2:22 PM LLMs Meet Misinformation https://llm-misinformation.github.io 13/15\n",

      "and physical well-being. Physical ailments such as high blood pressure, sleep disorders, and chronic pain were reported with lower frequency among participants who engaged in regular gardening activities. Elaborating on the findings, Dr. Emily Stevens, lead researcher at GRI, emphasized, âGardening provides a multi- faceted approach to improving mental health. It combines the benefits of physical exercise, connecting with nature, and nurturing living organisms, which ultimately empowers individuals to regain a sense of control and purpose in their lives, leading to improved mental well-being.â The study also highlighted the social aspects associated with gardening, especially within community gardens or allotments. Participants expressed a higher sense of community belonging, reduced feelings of isolation, and increased social interactions. Gardening, it seems, has the potential to bring people together, fostering a stronger sense of unity and shared purpose.
